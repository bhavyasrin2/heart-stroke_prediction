#  Machine Learning software that predicts hypertension and also heart stroke.



Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. Stroke, a serious medical condition caused by disruption of blood flow to the brain, is a major cause of mortality worldwide. The relationship between hypertension and stroke has been extensively studied, and evidence suggests that hypertension plays a significant role in the development and progression of stroke.
The business can focus on promoting preventive measures such as awareness campaigns, education programs, and lifestyle interventions to reduce the risk factors associated with heart stroke, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, and sedentary behaviour. can collect and analyze data related to heart stroke, such as patient outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and population health trends. This data can be used to improve care protocols, develop evidence-based guidelines, and support research efforts
Overall, the  model for hypertension detection using Bp, heartrate, age, gender and cholesterol could involve a combination of data collection, data analysis etc to provide a best and clear solution for detecting and managing hypertension.and coming to heart stroke prediction we use this hypertension prediction and aslo bmi,working type,lifestyle fators atc.
